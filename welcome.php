        <p> Our goal is to provide you as a student or youth traveler all the necessary opportunities and make provisions available for personal development from out-of-classroom education through educational travel opportunities, exchange, work and learn programs and cultural immersion that will promote mutual understanding, respect for individual abilities irrespective of their background and peaceful co-existence globally. </p><p>
Education gained through travel is out-of-classroom, holistic in defining your outlook to versatile issues and becomes a part of you. </p><p>
Unlike certificates and diplomas, it cannot be taken away from you. It is your experience and has become a part of you. </p><p>
The work and travel programs we have are focused on empowering and giving individuals the necessary out-of the-classroom experience for long term personal development.
